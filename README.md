Weather Web Application

A React-based weather web application that displays real-time weather information for any selected location. The application shows temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other atmospheric conditions using live weather data. It also provides hourly and future temperature forecasts for the same day, allowing users to view weather changes over time. The interface updates dynamically based on weather conditions and location input.
